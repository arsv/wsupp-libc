This is a standalone version of wsupp, the WPA supplicant from minibase,
ported to standard libc and with minibase-specific parts removed.


                       !! DO NOT USE THIS VERSION !!

                 unless you are absolutely positively sure
                 libc dependency is beneficial in your case
                            (hint: it is not)

                See https://github.com/arsv/minibase instead.


Once connection is established, this version attempts to spawn `dhcp $iface`
which is expected to configure the interface. The command should preferably
be short-running, but wsupp can tolerate long-running ones as well.

This version uses the same client protocol and the same file formats
as the original one from minibase. However, `wifi` here lack commands
to start or stop the service, because those require `ifmon` to work.


How to build:

    ./configure [cc=musl-gcc static]
    make
    make DESTDIR=... install

How to use:

    wsupp wlan0

    wifi
    wifi scan
    wifi connect Blackhole
    wifi disconnect


The port is somewhat dirty right now, in that it retains code that makes
sense within minibase but not so much in libc environment. Maybe I will
fix that at some point.

If you are looking for a simple WPA supplicant to study,
check `wpa` from https://github.com/arsv/minibase/temp/wifi
