/* Structures common for all(?) netlink protocols except UDEV.

   None of the supported ones actually sends raw nlmsg-s,
   all of them have some sort of extra header fields.
   
   Pretty much any request may be replied to with a nlerr packet.
   "err" there is a kernel return code like -EINVAL or -ENOENT.
   Value 0 means ACK of a successful request, and only gets sent
   if there was NLM_F_ACK in the request packet.

   All userspace-to-kernel packets must carry NLM_F_REQUEST flag.
   
   "Set-something" requests without NLM_F_ACK produce no reply
   on success and nlerr on error, messing up request-reply
   sequences. Such requests must always be sent with ACK enabled.
   
   "Get-something" requests return their respective structures
   on success or nlerr on error. Setting NLM_F_ACK results in
   *both* ACK and the result struct being sent on success,
   messing up request-reply sequences again. Such requests
   must always be send without ACK.
 
   Multipart replies have NLM_F_MULTI in each data packet,
   and those are followed by a single empty NLMSG_DONE packet. */
